## PCB Plotter

The plotter is a computer printer for printing vector graphics. This is a DIY PCB Ink Plotter using Arduino and GRBL CNC.  Using a pen, we will plot a circuit board configuration onto the target media in a precise and controlled manner.

System components include:
* Electrical schematic
* Physical Structure
* Software

## PCB
A printed circuit board ([PCB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printed_circuit_board)) mechanically supports and electrically connects electronic components or electrical components using conductive tracks, pads and other features etched from one or more sheet layers of copper laminated onto and/or between sheet layers of a non-conductive substrate. Components are generally soldered onto the PCB to both electrically connect and mechanically fasten them to it.
